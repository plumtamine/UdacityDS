Q1

September and October are the peaks of the price while from December to March is the slow season in Boston. Friday and Saturday have the highest price while Monday to Wednesday has the lowest. Interesting to see the relatively high price on Mondays and Sundays in April, which is the probable result of the famous Boston Marathon that held on April Monday in 2016. Another interesting fact is the highest price in September is on Thursday.

Q2

Although listings vary in size and quality, the average price in the different neighborhoods would provide a benchmark for the new hosts who are trying to decide the price of their listings. Leather District is the highest in Boston with an average price of $344.7 and Hyde Park having the lowest average price of $68.8

Q3
1. The top rental feature for a new host to consider when deciding the pricing is if the room type of rental is Entire home/apt.
2. Price more with more bathrooms available.
3. Better to price the extra people fee under 50.
4. Setting the minimum nights more than 4 nights might be too much commitment for tenants
5. For the listings in the Beacon Hill area, the hosts can take advantage of this famous neighborhood when considering pricing. 
6. The hosts who have more than one listing will price differently than the hosts who have only one listing.
7. The more review a listing has, the more impact it will have on the pricing.
8. The number of guests included will also impact the listing's pricing.
9. The hosts who respond will bring more to the tenants, thus can price more.
10. Price more with more bathrooms available.
